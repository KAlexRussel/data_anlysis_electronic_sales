Exploratory Analysis of Sales for an Electronics Retail Chain

In the datasets/SalesAnalysis folder, we have sales data for a company for the year 2019. There is one CSV file per month.

Each file contains the following columns:

OrderID: unique order identifier
Product: product description
Quantity Ordered: quantity sold
Price each: unit price
order date: purchase date
Purchase address: sales store address
We will analyze this data to answer the following questions:

What is the best sales month? and What is the revenue for that month?
In which city did we sell the most products?
At what time should we advertise to increase our sales?
Which product sold the most and why?
We will accompany our solutions with relevant visualizations to help the business improve its figures for the following year.
